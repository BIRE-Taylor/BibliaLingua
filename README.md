# BibliaLingua

An android application written using the LDS Gospel Library REST API to download and display available materials in two languages.  It was written completely using the AIDE app on an android device and as such the code is not well commented or well ordered.  It has also been tested on limited devices and android versions so there may be bugs.  Various libraries have been used and will be cited at a later point in time. I collect no information through this app.  For privacy information check with the google play store and lds website privacy policy.
